# DETECTION_of_DOS-ATTACKS_FOR_IOT_NETWORK_2023
DETECTION of DOS ATTACKS FOR IOT NETWORK BASED ON ANOMALY DETECTION IDS TECHNIQUE AND MACHINE LEARNING ALGORITHMS

1- For writing our software code, we used the Jupiter Netbook, which features a flexible user interface for configuring and arranging workflows in fields like data science, machine learning, and statistical computing. Hence, we used the Jupiter Netbook to develop ML code. The IDE you can use for this is PyCharm or Visual Code. If you choose to utilize the PyCharm IDE, you need to download the professional version since it has the Jupiter network. Also, we downloaded Python version 3.9.13 to write our software code.

2- In order to begin writing our software, we first installed all the necessary packages such as Pandas, NumPy, time, Seaborn, and so on. In order to do that, we used the command pip install [package name]

Next, we downloaded the IoTID20 dataset from its website and saved it on the desktop.

3- In our code, we loaded the dataset and began preprocessing it. Preprocessing of data includes encoding, cleaning, and removing features. You can find the source code of Encoding and  the clean dataset function in the follwing figures.
